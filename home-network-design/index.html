As with other systems� design disciplines, network design follows an analysis stage, where requirements are generated, and precedes implementation, where the system (or relevant system component) is constructed. Network design contains the specific design information, such as logical and physical topology, network diagrams, ip addressing, routing protocols, and security configurations.
